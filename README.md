spiel
=====

A markdown/jsdoc tool for html/css/js written as a nodejs module

The purpose of this documentation tool is for a requirement; to treat markdown and jsdoc as one, when writing code comments and descriptions.

This is not intended to remove the need for speclets, in fact spiel assumes your project will contain a speclet dir when parsing (more on this later), the idea is that when you need to add an explanation to a class, function, variable, etc. etc. markdown could help in structuring parts of your comments you deem important to highlighting to the reader.  Anyway enough of my “spiel” (couldn’t resist!), on ward!
